  Discrete modelling has proven over the years that it can bring powerful analyses and corresponding insight to the many cases where precise biological data is not sufficiently available to build a detailed quantitative model.
  This is even more true for very big models where such data is frequently missing and led to a constant increase in size of logical models \emph{à la} Thomas.
  The analysis of such models is mostly based on attractor computation, since those correspond roughly to \emph{phenotypes}, and the recent use of trap-spaces made a real breakthrough in that domain allowing to consider medium-sized models that used to be out of reach.
  However, with the continuing increase in model-size, the state of the art computation of minimal trap-spaces based on prime-implicants shows its limits as there can be very many such implicants.
  In this article we present an alternative method to compute minimal trap-spaces, and hence complex attractors, that relies on a completely different technique, namely the enumeration of maximal siphons in the Petri-net encoding of the original Logical model.
  We then demonstrate its efficiency and compare it to implicant-based methods on a few relevant big Boolean models.

\section{Introduction}

Discrete modelling has proven over the years that it can bring powerful analyses and corresponding insight to the many cases where precise biological data is not sufficiently available to build a detailed quantitative model.
This is even more true for very big models where such data is frequently missing and led to a constant increase in size of logical models \emph{à la} Thomas.
The analysis of such models is mostly based on attractor computation, since those correspond roughly to \emph{phenotypes}, and the recent use of trap-spaces made a real breakthrough in that domain allowing to consider medium-sized models that used to be out of reach.
However, with the continuing increase in model-size, the state of the art computation of minimal trap-spaces based on prime-implicants shows its limits as there can be very many such implicants.
In this article we present an alternative method to compute minimal trap-spaces, and hence complex attractors, that relies on a completely different technique, namely the enumeration of maximal siphons in the Petri-net encoding of the original Logical model.
We then demonstrate its efficiency and compare it to implicant-based methods on a few relevant big Boolean models.
